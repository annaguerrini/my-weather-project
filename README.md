This is the code I used on my weather app
You can see it live here: https://elated-goodall-0e0d0f.netlify.app/

What you are able to see here 👀: 
 - 📍 the current temperature, wind and humidity in any city around the world + in your current location! 
 - hourly forecast for the next SIX HOURS 🤩
 - weekly forecast for the next SIX DAYS 📅
 - convert the units from Celsius to Fahrenheit and back

Use it for a real time forecast experience!
